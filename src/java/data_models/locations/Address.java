 * Address class represents an address containing a street, city, state, and

 * All fields are required to be NON NULL.
 *
 * If street or city fields are too long to save to the database, the values will
 * be truncated to fit.
 *
 * State must be a 2 letter character array.
 *
 * Zip codes are stored as a fully qualified zip code with +4 suffix in the form:
 * 99999-9999.
 *
 * In general, all zip codes should include the +4 suffix, even if it is unknown,
 * however if a 5 digit zip code is provided, this class will automatically append
 * the -0000 indicating the +4 suffix is unknown at instantiation or when set.
